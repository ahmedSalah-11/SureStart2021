# SureStart2021


## Reflections

### Day 1 (2/8):
I'm very excited to start this journey and learn more about machine learning and Ai and meet new people. I hope to spend each day learning new things and boost my skills. The only thing I am worried about is my final exams which will be in the middleÂ of February so I hope this doesn't affect my progress in this program.
