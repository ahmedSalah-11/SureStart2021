# SureStart2021


## Reflections

### Day 1 (2/8):
I'm very excited to start this journey and learn more about machine learning and Ai and meet new people. I hope to spend each day learning new things and boost my skills. The only thing I am worried about is my final exams which will be in the middle of February so I hope this doesn't affect my progress in this program.



### Day 2 (2/9):
#### Question 1-What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
In `supervised learning` the model is trained on a set of examples(training data) and their associated labels,then by using ML algorithms the model learns from the data and it can predict accurate answers for new data.
In `unsupervised learning` the model is given the examples only and by using the unsupervised ml algorithms the model finds patterns and relationships between the data.

#### Question 2-Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries:
Scikit-Learn is a ML library that contains a lot of efficient tools and algorithms for machine learning and statistical modeling only and can't be used in any visualization.

### Day 3 (2/10):
#### Question 1-What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?
Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays with a uniform type and kind of like numpy arrays.They are immutaple like python strings so you can never update it's content.In ML tensors are used to store complex multi-dimensional data which will make solving problems with this data easier.

#### Question 2-What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?
You have to initialize a session  to perform actual computations on tensors.
